\@writefile{lof}{\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {1}{\ignorespaces Fig 1a. shows the scale height-fraction of Ia/CC parameter space. The color-bar shows the likelihood values. Fig. 1[b-c] shows the cumulative histograms of the observed (green) luminosities compared to the model luminosities (purple) for 50 snapshots, for given values of fraction and scale height. The vertical dashed line is the luminosity cutoff, above which i'm doing my model-observation comparison.   \textbf  {NOTE}: Don't trust the contours in Fig 1a. since I used interpolation to construct them from (10x10) data points. Nevertheless, you can still see the "good" areas of the parameter space.\relax }}{1}}
