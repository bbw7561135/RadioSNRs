* Type Ib/c SNe - hydrogen (or nearly) free SNe, believed to arise from Wolf-Rayet Stars.
* SN Ib/c Rate - 1/4th massive star supernovae - important mode of massive star death, but not enough to account for all - binary evolution is important
* **Ib/c also related gamma ray bursts** -E.g. spatial and temporal correlation, optical and radio energy display from SN 1998wb and GRB 980425, 

Late time radio observations of SNe Ib/c could yield detection of off-axis GRB jet that slowed down and radiated isotropically. 

**Why radio emission dominated by forward shock and not reverse shock?**

1. FW has higher velocity, post-shock energy density and volume of shocked gas.
2. Magnetic field amplification at reverse shock small - since SNE is expanding
3. X-Ray observations of Tycho SNR - PAcc primarily at forward shock ([Warren et. al 2005](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005ApJ...634..376W))
